### H3_evaluation

This folder contains the data used for the evaluation phylogeny inferred from 7,127 HA sequences of seasonal human influenza A/H3N2 isolates, sampled between 1968 and 2014.

### H3_PatchInference

This folder contains the data (phylogenetic tree, alignment, antigenic weights) used to infer antigenic patches on the surface of the hemagglutinin protein.

### Patches

This folder contains an executable to run the AntiPatch software, two bash scripts, the test data and evaluation data.
