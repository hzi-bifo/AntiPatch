Antipatch

--- install ---
To use antipatch your system must have installed make and g++.
If you dif not want to use the g++ compiler, 
that is found in your path, you have to change it in the makefile.
Otherwise open a console, 
change to the root path (where you found this README too)
and type 'make'.

This will produce a path named AntiPatch/bin, where all compiled src will lay in
and the programm 'antipatch'.

The command 'make dist-clean' will delete all exept the program 'antipatch' and the src files.

--- run ---
To run antipatch you have the choice to edit the config file or to type the 
parameter in your system.

- - - use config:
./antipatch config_surfaceOnly

- - - use paramter option:
./antipatch -i testdata/SEAS_H1_dnds.pfd -n testresults/surfaceAndBurried -g testdata/testfiles/oneValue.onlyInternal -s testdata/3hmg -f 0.187 -b testdata/3HMG.pdb -r oneValueInternal
