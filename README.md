## Antipatch

This repository contains all data that is published in the manuscript 'Determination of antigenicity-altering patches of sites on the major surface protein of human influenza A/H3N2 viruses'

### H3_evaluation

This folder contains the data used for the evaluation phylogeny inferred from 7,127 HA sequences of seasonal human influenza A/H3N2 isolates, sampled between 1968 and 2014.

### H3_PatchInference

This folder contains the data (phylogenetic tree, alignment, antigenic weights) used to infer antigenic patches on the surface of the hemagglutinin protein. The collection comprised 258 seasonal human in-
fluenza A (H3N2) virus isolates from 1968 to 2003.

### Patches

This folder contains an executable and a bash script to run the AntiPatch software, the test data and evaluation data. 

### Figures_Tables

This folder contains all figures and table from our manuscript.
